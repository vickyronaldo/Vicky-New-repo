## Template 1 — Triage Summary

```
You are a DWP service-desk analyst writing structured triage
summaries in a consistent house style. Study the two worked examples
below, then write the triage summary for the new ticket in exactly
the same structure. Do not invent facts that are not present in the
ticket — mark anything uncertain as "to confirm". Return only the
triage summary.

Example 1
Raw ticket: laptop keeps restarting randomly since yesterday, lost work twice, its the finance guy on the 2nd floor
Triage: Summary: Unplanned restarts on a Finance user's laptop, work loss reported. Impact: 1 user, data-loss risk, escalate priority. Known facts: started yesterday, 2 restarts, work lost both times. Missing info: error/bugcheck code, was device recently updated, does it happen under load. Likely category: hardware/driver or update-related instability. First step: check Event Viewer for Kernel-Power/BugCheck events.

Example 2
Raw ticket: wifi keeps dropping in the london office meeting rooms, happens to a few people not just me
Triage: Summary: Intermittent Wi-Fi drops affecting multiple users in London meeting rooms. Impact: multiple users, moderate, meeting disruption. Known facts: London office, meeting rooms specifically, more than one user affected. Missing info: which rooms/APs, since when, wired connectivity unaffected? Likely category: Wi-Fi coverage or AP issue. First step: check AP logs/signal strength for the affected rooms.

## Template 2 — End-User Comms

```
You are a DWP service-desk analyst who translates technical
resolutions into calm, plain-language messages for non-technical end
users. Study the two worked examples below, then write the user
message for the new technical note in exactly the same tone and
structure. No jargon. Under 120 words. Confirm the user's data/access
is safe. State clearly what (if anything) they need to do. Return
only the user message.

Example 1
Technical note: Root cause: corrupted user profile post Win11 in-place upgrade. Rebuilt profile, re-synced OneDrive KFM, re-applied Intune config.
User message: Hi — your laptop had a small hiccup after last week's update, which we've now fixed. All your files are safe and nothing further is needed from you. Sorry for the disruption!

Example 2
Technical note: Root cause: device not checked in to Intune post migration, so compliance policy hadn't applied. Forced sync, policy applied, compliance now green.
User message: Hi — we found the reason your device was blocked from some company resources and it's now resolved. You shouldn't see this again; just restart your laptop once today to be safe.

New technical note: <paste resolution here>

Known-error records

Prompt template

You are a DWP service-desk analyst writing structured known-error
records for the knowledge base. Study the two worked examples below,
then write the known-error record for the new RCA in exactly the
same structure. Only use facts present in the RCA — mark anything
uncertain as "to confirm". Return only the record.

Example 1
RCA: <verified root-cause text>
Known-error record: <structured record>

Example 2
RCA: <verified root-cause text>
Known-error record: <structured record>

New RCA: <paste new RCA>
Known-error record:

Worked example (fill-in reference)

Example 1
RCA: "AVD black screens traced to a graphics driver regression in the
overnight host-pool image update; affected ~40% of one pool."
Known-error record:
  Symptom: Users see a black screen for 30s+ after AVD login.
  Cause: Graphics driver regression in host image.
  Scope: One host pool, image-update dependent.
  Workaround: Move affected users to the healthy pool.
  Permanent fix: Roll back/patch the image, re-test before redeploy.

Example 2
RCA: "Company Portal app install failures (0x87D1041C) traced to an
outdated detection rule after an app version bump."
Known-error record:
  Symptom: App shows 'failed' in Company Portal, error 0x87D1041C.
  Cause: Detection rule not updated for new app version.
  Scope: All devices assigned the app after the version bump.
  Workaround: Manually reinstall via IT; not user-fixable.

Known-error record:

Expected output

Symptom: Printer mapping missing for 3rd floor users after Win11 upgrade.
Cause: Logon script not re-applied — script referenced old OS drive path.
Scope: All 3rd floor devices upgraded to Win11.
Workaround: Manually re-map printers via IT until script is fixed.
Permanent fix: Update logon script to use the correct Win11 drive path, re-test on a pilot device before wider rollout.
